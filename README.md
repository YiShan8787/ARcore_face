# ARcore_face
 script in Unity

 using LSL to connect to python, 
 and then python send socket to unity (because only python and matlab provide the library to calculate connectivity), 
 after unity get the message, 
 the app will show the brain connectivity from the bci device(bci just send raw data). 
 In addition, python will keep sending message, and Unity will keep receiving it until the app end.
 
 demo video will upload someday
